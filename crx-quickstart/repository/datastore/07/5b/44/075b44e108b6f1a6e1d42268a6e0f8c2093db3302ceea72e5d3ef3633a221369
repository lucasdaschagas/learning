  "Because the eye is less sensitive to high-frequency color information than high-frequency luminance, JPEG images divide image information into luminance and color components. When a JPEG image is compressed, the luminance component is left at full resolution, while the color components are downsampled by averaging together groups of pixels. Downsampling reduces the data volume by one half or one third with almost no impact on perceived quality. Downsampling is not applicable to grayscale images. This technique reduces the amount of compression useful for images with high contrast (for example, images with overlaid text).":

  "Specifies the type of navigation frame to use. When set to <code>cursor</code>, the component uses a fixed-size reference cursor.

Flyout view animation begins only after a highlight or cursor fade in animation completes. There is no fade out animation when a user deactivates the flyout.
